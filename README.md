# Reserve VIP seats at your favorite nightclub tonight!

Sign on via Facebook to reserve your seat at a table tonight in San Francisco! No need to reserve the entire table for you and your friends. Instead, choose an open table at the venue of your choice and reserve as many seats as you need. Other users can reserve the remaining seats. Once your table fills up, your reservation is confirmed with the club. You will be charged only for the number of seats in your reservation. Enjoy the night with new friends and old.
